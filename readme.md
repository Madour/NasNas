#### Build

This project uses Cmake. To build (Linux and Windows, not tested on macOS):
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . -j4
```
This will generate a shared library, a static library and the demo application.

If Cmake is unable to find your SFML install location, configure CMakeLists.txt by
setting SFML_ROOT variable. 

#### Get Started

Here is a sample code using NasNas framework, this will create a 720x480 window and log a string to the console : 

```c++
#include "NasNas.h"

class Game : public ns::App {
public:
    Game() : ns::App("My game", 720, 480) {
        ns_LOG("Created a NasNas app !");
    }
    void onEvent(sf::Event event) override {
        if (event.type == sf::Event::Closed)
            getWindow().close();
    }
    void update() override {}
};

int main() {
    Game g;
    g.run();
    return 0;
}
```

Please check the [example game](https://github.com/Madour/NasNas/tree/master/example) source code
for a more complete overview of what you can do with the framework.

Documentation (work in progress) can be found [here](https://madour.github.io/NasNas/doc).

A step by step tutorial to learn how to use the features will be written soonâ„¢ .
