<h1> NasNas </h1>
<h3> An intuitive and user friendly 2D game framework for C++. </h3>
<h5> Under construction </h5>
<hr>

<p><b>NasNas</b> is a lightweight <b>cross platform</b> modular <b>2D game framework</b> with a focus on pixel art style games.</p>


<p>It is entirely written in <b>modern C++17</b>, and doesn't have any dependency other than SFML2.</p>

<p>It provides a <b>clean</b> and <b>easy to use</b> API.</p>

<p>The framework is separated in multiple independent modules :</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b><i>Core</b></i> and <b><i>Data</b></i> are the only non optional modules. 
		They are needed to create a NasNas application. They contain core classes and data needed by the framework.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b><i>Reslib</b></i> contains the resource manager and resource loader. It handles resource loading and 
		accessing in a very elegant way. This module is optional, you can use your own resource manager and loader if you have specific needs.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b><i>ECS</b></i> contains the BaseEntity and Components classes. You can add Components to your BaseEntity derived classes 
		to add more functionalities to them, like graphics, basic physics, collider, inputs.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b><i>Tilemapping</b></i> is a Tiled Map loader (.tmx). It seamlessly integrates with NasNas and speeds up development
		for tile based games.
	</li>

	<li>More modules will be developed in the future !</li>
